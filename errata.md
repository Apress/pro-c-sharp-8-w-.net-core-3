# Errata for *Pro C# 8 with .NET Core 3

**Chapter 1**

[On **page 10** in the first paragraph of "Additional .NET Core Aware Programming Languages it says that "ASP.NET Core applications are limited to C#. This is not true as Razor pages are limited to C#, but the code-behind and the class can be written in any .NET Core compatible language.]

Instead of this:

Understand that C# is not the only language that can be used to build .NET Core applications. .NET Core
applications can generally be built with C#, Visual Basic, and F#. ASP.NET Core applications are limited to C#.

It should appear as this:

Understand that C# is not the only language that can be used to build .NET Core applications. .NET Core
applications can generally be built with C#, Visual Basic, and F#. 

(Thank you to Patrick Lanz for reporting this errata)

**Chapter 2**

[On **page 31** the "note" has an error.]

It should read like this:

Note Creating solutions and projects can also be accomplished using the .NET Core CLI. For example, to create a new solution, enter dotnet new sln -n SimpleCSharpConsoleApp. To create a new .NET Core C# Console application, enter dotnet new console -lang C# -n SimpleCSharpConsoleApp. To add the new console app to the solution, enter dotnet sln add SimpleCSharpConsoleApp. This is just a small sample of what the CLI is capable of. To discover everything the CLI can do, enter dotnet -h

**Chapter 3** 

[On **page 52** in the section that begins with “The following output shows…”, the following sentence should be removed:] 

"Of course, if you did not specify command-line arguments via the Visual Studio Debug tab, you will not find them printed to the console."

(Thank you to Mehmet Kaya for reporting)


**Chapter 22**

[On page **828** a reader asked, “When adding the Make entity, why does OnModelCreating() method  not contain a definition for the relation between  Inventory and Makes table? It's either per convention or because entity.HasQueryFilter(c => c.MakeId == MakeId); automatically defines it.”]

The response is:

It's defined on the models themselves, and therefore doesn't need to be in the onmodelcreating. You only need to define a relationship in the onmodelcreating if you choose not to define the navigation properties on the models or if you need to alter the cascade behavior. We will make that more apparent in the next edition.

  [InverseProperty(nameof(Make.Cars))]
  public Make MakeNavigation { get; set; }

  [InverseProperty(nameof(Car.MakeNavigation))]
  public IEnumerable<Car> Cars { get; set; } = new List<Car>();


[On **page 836** in the last paragraph that begins with "Delete the Data and Reseed..." there is a typo.] 

Instead of:

"Open the StoreDataInitializer.cs class"

It should read: 

"Open the SampleDataInitializer.cs class"

[On **page 836** there is a typo in the last paragraph.] 

Instead of: 

“DBCC ChecIdent"

It should read:

"DBCC CheckIdent"

(Thank you to Herbert Feichtinger for reporting this typo)


**Chapter 23**

[On **page 865** the code following the paragraph that begins with "Another constructor takes an instance..." should read like this:]

private readonly bool _disposeContext;
protected BaseRepo(DbContextOptions<ApplicationDbContext> options)
 : this(new ApplicationDbContext(options)) {
  _disposeContext = true;
}
 
 [On **page 852** there is a missing assert at the end of the page "ShouldSortByFirstNameThenLastName()"]

The code in the Sort Records example should be this:

[Fact]
public void ShouldSortByFirstNameThenLastName()
{
  var customers = Context.Customers
    .OrderBy(x => x.PersonalInformation.LastName)
    .ThenBy(x => x.PersonalInformation.FirstName).ToList();
  if (customers.Count <= 1)
  {
    return;
  }
  for (int x = 0; x < customers.Count-1; x++)
  {
    var compareLastName = string.Compare(customers[x].PersonalInformation.LastName,
      customers[x + 1].PersonalInformation.LastName, StringComparison.CurrentCultureIgnoreCase);
    Assert.True(compareLastName <= 0);
    if (compareLastName == 0)
    {
      var compareFirstName = string.Compare(customers[x].PersonalInformation.FirstName,
        customers[x + 1].PersonalInformation.FirstName, StringComparison.CurrentCultureIgnoreCase);
      Assert.True(compareLastName <= 0);
    }
  }
}



 
 [On **page 869** there is a typo in the paragraph in the listing that appears under Entity-Specific Repo Interfaces.]

IMakeIRepo.cs   

should read:

IMakeRepo.cs

(Thank you to Herbert Feichtinger for reporting this typo)


**Chapter 25**

[On **page 943** the “Note” indicates that a much deeper look at commands is in chapter 30. It should be chapter 28.] 

It should read:

Note  Chapter 28 will take a much deeper look into the WPF command system. In it, you will create custom commands base on ICommand as well as RelayCommands.
